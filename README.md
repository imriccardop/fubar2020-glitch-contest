# Project: change without choice
This project uses the technics of generative art and it was made for [/’fu:bar/](https://fubar.space/) Glitch Art 2020 Contest.  
The web app generates a random image but the user doesn't have any control over it.  
"Change without choice" try to mix the art of Mark Rothko and Gerhard Richter with digital errors.
